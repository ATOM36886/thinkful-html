# Introduction to HTML and CSS

Websites are made up of many things, but HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) are two of the most important components. Together, they are the building blocks for every single webpage on the Internet.

Think of a car. It, too, is made up of many things. Doors. Windows. Tires. Seats. In the world of HTML, these are the `elements`. Meanwhile, each of those elements are different. Perhaps they differ by size. Or color. Or wear and tear. These attributes are used to define how the `elements` look.

> Before we start, you need a source code editor, which is simply a text editor designed specifically for writing source code. Some popular editors include Notepade++ (Windows), TextMate (Mac), and Sublime Text (cross-platform). For this exercise, please download the cross-platform editor [Gedit](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Gedit#Download), which is an open-source editor designed for simplicity and ease of use.



Now let's turn to an actual web page ..

## HTML

HTML gives a web pages structure, allowing you to view it from a web browser:

```html
<html>
  <head></head>
  <body>
    <h1>Bees!</h1>
    <p>
      <img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3775/12059206813_e37135c9cf_z.jpg"/>
    </p>
  </body>
</html>
```


1. Tags form the structure of your page. There usually is an opening tag and then a closing tag, like - <div></div>.
2.Elements represent the tags as well as whatever falls within the tags, like - <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
3. Selectors are used to select the tag for some purpose. In our case we are going to use them for defining styles 

### Task create your own page

Let's make this look better.

## CSS

While HTML provides, structure, CSS is used for styling, making webpages look nice. From the size of the text to the background colors to the positionging of HTML elements, CSS gives you control over almost every visual aspect of a page.


CSS and HTML work in tandem. CSS styles (or rules) are applied directly to HTML elements. For example:

### Task add your own styles
