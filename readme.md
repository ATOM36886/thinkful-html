# Introduction to HTML and CSS

Websites are made up of many things, but HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) are two of the most important components. Together, they are the building blocks for every single webpage on the Internet.

Think of a car. It, too, is made up of many things. Doors. Windows. Tires. Seats. In the world of HTML, these are the `elements`. Meanwhile, each of those elements are different. Perhaps they differ by size. Or color. Or wear and tear. These attributes are used to define how the `elements` look.

Now let's turn to an actual web page ..

## HTML

HTML gives a web pages structure, allowing you to view it from a web browser:

```html
<html>
  <head></head>
  <body>
    <h1>Bees!</h1>
    <p>
      <img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3775/12059206813_e37135c9cf_z.jpg"/>
    </p>
  </body>
</html>
```

elements:
1. tags (some close, some don't)
2. attributes

### Task create your own page

Let's make this look better.

## CSS

While HTML provides, structure, CSS is used for styling, making webpages look nice. From the size of the text to the background colors to the positionging of HTML elements, CSS gives you control over almost every visual aspect of a page.


CSS and HTML work in tandem. CSS styles (or rules) are applied directly to HTML elements. For example:

### Task add your own styles
