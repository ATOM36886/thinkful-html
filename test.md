So, I'm Michael Herman. I'm a Python and Frontend mentor here at Thinkful. I've been a back-end developer in Ruby and Python for about three years. I wrote a Python course for learning web development called Real Python.

Lots of people ask me about mentorship in general. Why is it so important? In my opinion, when you are learning, finding a mentor is one of the most important tasks. Just having someone there to talk to, who struggled in many of the same ways makes a huge difference. Without the mentor I had, I wouldn't be here today. This is exactly what makes Thinkful special, and why I am a part of it.

So that's who I am. I'd love to know who you are. So, let's just go around quickly. Just say your name, how much experience you have with programming, and where you're from. Oh and also indicate whether you know were able to download the text editor, Sublime text, and whether you have Chrome installed. A simple yes or no wil suffice. You can either speak if you have a microphone or type it in the chat window.

Alright, so today we will be going over the very basics of HTML and CSS. I've created a blog post to go along with this tutorial, which I'll send out after we're done. 

You will be coding today. If you want, you can code a long with me. Or if you'd rather observe that's fine too. Either way, there will be times that I stop coding or lecturing and ask that you code on your own. 

If you have questions, please please either shout it out over me or enter it into the chat window. I won't always be able to see the chat so bear with me if I don't get to your question right away. We will also have a more formal Q&A session at the end if you want to save your questions until then.

Okay, without further ado, let's begin ..

Any questions?

Thanks so much. I hope this was helpful. My email is michael@realpython.com. Feel free to contact me about anything. Well, anything programming related. Thanks!
